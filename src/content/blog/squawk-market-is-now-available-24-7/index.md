## Financial Sector Concerns

Due to recent market volatility and financial sector concerns, we've activated our market wide feed to run 24/7. This feed collects headlines and news from a global macro perspective, keeping you updated on breaking headlines related to the markets at large.

## New Features

Since launch, we've already added two new features to the market wide squawk:

1. Percentage changes in sectors (Technology, Basic Materials, etc.). We track all the major economic sectors in realtime, and when one breaks out beyond a plus or minus 1%, we will squawk it. This is a great way to stay on top of the market intraday, and to be aware of which sectors are moving the most.

2. We've added CNN's fear and greed index to our squawk. Whenever this value changes, you'll hear about it. While the Fear and Greed index itself is derived from a variety of metrics, it's a great way to get a quick pulse on the overall sentiment in the market.

3. Toggleable browser notifications. We've added a toggle to the settings page to enable or disable browser notifications. If you like to keep the feed muted but still want updates, this is a great option. Simply click the "Enable Browser Notifications" button to enable them:

<div class="text-center">

## Feedback, Feature Requests, Questions?

To be brutally honest, we're currently not making any money from this as a service, and we've received to date no feedback from the community. All advertising and marketing is also going quite poorly. I'm not sure why, I myself use this service daily while I trade to keep tabs on breaking news in the market. So please, let us know what you think is crucially missing or what we could to better. I'm hear to learn, improve my craft and products, and give you the best possible service.
