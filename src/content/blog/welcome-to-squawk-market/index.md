## What is "Squawk"?

If you are a seasoned trader, you may be familiar this term already. However, if you're a beginner, you may have no idea what this is. "Squawk" is simply a term for a live market news feed, typically in the form of spoken word. It's an essential tool in any trader's toolkit.

## How to Use Squawk Market

First, [sign up to access the dashboard](/subscribe), or [login](/login) to Squawk Market if you have an account. You'll get a link to the [dashboard](/dashboard) in your email. Once you're in, you'll see the wide array of feeds that we offer, with title, description, and a 'connect' button:

<div class="text-center">
<img alt="Dashboard with no feeds activated" src="/images/activateFeeds.png" class="img-fluid border rounded p-1 m-3"/>
</div>

You can click 'connect' on any one of them, and as soon as you see 'disconnect', you're connected to that feed! You'll see live squawks start to collect in the sidebar (if on desktop), and below (if on mobile):

<div class="text-center">
<img alt="Dashboard with market wide feed activated" src="/images/feedsActivated.png" class="img-fluid border rounded p-1 m-3"/>
</div>

You can click on any squawk again at any time to replay the full squawk. Soon we'll include the original link to the source of the squawk, so you can go directly the full article or source.

## How is the Service so Affordable?

At [Full Stack Craft](https://fullstackcraft.com), we like to keep things as lean as possible, utilizing a variety of powerful yet affordable AI tools. For the technically interested, we make use of the following services:

- [Google Cloud Speech-to-Text](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text)
- [Google Cloud Text-to-Speech](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech)
- [Open AI's text-davinci-0003 model*](https://platform.openai.com/playground)

*Contrary to popular belief a _more_ powerful version than ChatGPT!

All of these services are extremely affordable, and some even include a generous free tier all together. Combining them with our own low latency custom code, we're proud to be able to offer an extremely low-latency market squawk service for less half the price of our competitors.

## Coming Soon

We're working on a variety of new feeds and features:

- Live press conference transcriptor 

With initial tests, **it appears that with a software-based approach, we'll be able to frontrun what is displayed and heard on live news broadcasts, conferences, and interviews by as much as 10-20 seconds**. We'll create a blog post about how exactly we are able to do this and how it's even possible. Our goal with this feed is to try it for the next FOMC meeting, and see if we can be one of the first services to report on the change in the fed funds rate - wether it will be 0, 25, or 50 bps.

- Symbol Based Feed Builder

Soon it will also be possible for you to enter a symbol of your choice, and what type of news related to that symbol you'd like to hear. For example, you could enter "AAPL" and "earnings", and you'll get a feed that only plays news related to Apple's earnings. Or "SPY" and "volume", and you'll get a feed that only plays news related to the volume of the S&P 500.

We truly believe that all these features we have in the pipeline (and are nearly done!) raise us well above the competition. Got an idea or recommendation yourself? We love the diversity of the trading community, and we'd love to hear from you. Please reach out to us with your idea on the [contact page](/contact), and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.

- Option Flow Feed

Option flow and metrics like Gamma, Vanna, and Charm exposure are all the rage currently, especially with the explosion of 0DTE options. We're working on a feed specifically dedicated to these flows, tracking option activity on major indexes like SPX, SPY, QQQ, and IWM.

- Latency Tester & Feed Builder

Got a favorite news source, blog, or data website you always use? Soon, you will be able to provide a URL of your choice and various keywords, and we'll test the latency our service requires to report the summary of that keyword for you. You'll be able to transform that test into your very own feed.

Even with all these feeds and features planned, we've still got a massive variety of other feeds in the pipeline, including:

- Bond Auction Feeds

- FOREX Feeds

- Commodities Feeds

- Futures Feeds

- Crypto Feeds

- Earnings Feeds

- IPO Feeds

- Analyst Ratings / Price Target Feeds

Reach out to us if any of these are of particular interest to you, and we'll prioritize them! (Otherwise we'll build them in the order we think they'll be most useful to the community - which isn't much more than a weak guess!)

We're hoping that Squawk Market is the last market squawk service you'll ever need. We're committed to building a service that is not only affordable, but also extremely powerful and versatile. We're excited to see what the future holds for Squawk Market!
