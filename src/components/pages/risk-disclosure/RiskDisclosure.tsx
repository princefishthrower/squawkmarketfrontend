          Stocks, options, futures, and forex trading contains substantial risk and is
          not for every investor. An investor could potentially lose all or more
          than the initial investment. Risk capital is money that can be lost
          without jeopardizing onesâ€™ financial security or lifestyle. Only risk
          capital should be used for trading and only those with sufficient risk
          capital should consider trading. Past performance is not necessarily
          indicative of future results.

          Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some
          of which are described below. No representation is being made that any
          account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to
          those shown; in fact, there are frequently sharp differences between
          hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently
          achieved by any particular trading program. One of the limitations of
          hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared
          with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does
          not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can
          completely account for the impact of financial risk of actual trading.
          for example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a
          particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material
          points which can also adversely affect actual trading results. There
          are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the
          implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully
          accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results
          and all which can adversely affect trading results.
